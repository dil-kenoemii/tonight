- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dil-kenoemii/tonight.git
   cd tonight/spindecide
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/spindecide
   SESSION_SECRET=<64-character-hex-string>
   NODE_ENV=development
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   Generate a session secret:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

4. **Create the database**
   ```bash
   createdb spindecide
   ```

5. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

6. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open the app**

   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📦 Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm start          # Start production server
npm run migrate    # Run database migrations

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Four main tables:

- **`rooms`** — Room codes, categories, status, winner
- **`participants`** — Names, host flag, veto status
- **`options`** — Option text, veto tracking, submitter
- **`sessions`** — Session tokens for authentication

See `lib/migrate.ts` for the complete schema.

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Session cookies:** HTTP-only, signed with HMAC-SHA256
- **Rate limiting:** In-memory sliding window rate limiter
- **Parameterized queries:** All SQL uses `$1, $2` placeholders to prevent injection
- **Input validation:** Room codes, names, and options are sanitized
- **SSL enforcement:** Production database connections use SSL

## 🚢 Deployment

### Deploy to Railway

1. **Connect GitHub repo** to Railway
2. **Add PostgreSQL** database plugin
3. **Set environment variables:**
   - `DATABASE_URL` (auto-set by Railway)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (64-char hex)
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (your Railway URL)
4. **Add pre-deploy step:** `npm run migrate`
5. **Create cleanup cron:**
   - New service with start command: `npm run cleanup`
   - Schedule: `0 * * * *` (hourly)
   - Reference `DATABASE_URL` from PostgreSQL

Railway automatically:
- Detects Next.js and builds with `npm run build`
- Starts with `npm start`
- Redeploys when you push to `main`

See [MILESTONES.md](../MILESTONES.md) for detailed deployment steps.

## 🎮 How It Works

### Room Lifecycle

1. **Host creates room** → Gets 6-character room code (e.g., `ABC123`)
2. **Participants join** → Via shareable link or room code
3. **Everyone adds options** → Max 3 per person
4. **Everyone can veto** → Exactly 1 veto per person
5. **Host spins wheel** → Cryptographically random selection
6. **Winner announced** → Confetti celebration! 🎊
7. **Auto-cleanup** → Room deleted after 24 hours

### Real-Time Updates

- Client polls `GET /api/rooms/[code]` every 2 seconds
- Server returns full room state (participants, options, status)
- No WebSockets needed — simple HTTP polling works great!

### Spinning Wheel

- Canvas-based animation with 60 FPS
- Ticking sound using Web Audio API
- Winner lands under top pointer (12 o'clock)
- 5-second spin for host, 3-second for participants
- Confetti celebration via `canvas-confetti`

|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/rooms` | Create new room |
| `GET` | `/api/rooms/[code]` | Get room state |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/[code]/join` | Join existing room |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/[code]/options` | Submit option |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/[code]/options/[id]/veto` | Veto option |
| `POST` | `/api/rooms/[code]/spin` | Spin wheel (host only) |
| `GET` | `/api/recent` | Get recent decisions |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Application Error" on page:**
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set
- Ensure migrations ran successfully

**Session doesn't persist:**
- Check `SESSION_SECRET` is 64-character hex string
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` matches your domain exactly (no trailing slash)
- Clear browser cookies and try again

**Database connection error:**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check `DATABASE_URL` format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
- For Railway, ensure SSL is configured (`ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`)
